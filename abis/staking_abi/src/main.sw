    // We do some fancy math here. Basically, any point in time, the amount of reward token
    // entitled to the owner of a lock but is pending to be distributed is:
    //
    //   pending reward = (lock_info.value * accRewardPerShare) - lock_info.rewardDebt + lock_info.unpaidRewards
    //
    // Whenever a user updates a lock, here's what happens:
    //   1. The farm's `acc_reward_per_share` and `last_reward_time` gets updated.
    //   2. Users pending rewards accumulate in `unpaid_rewards`.
    //   3. User's `value` gets updated.
    //   4. User's `reward_debt` gets updated.
